<div class="text">
<p>Ainoa bustled around the classroom, a smile on her face hiding the anxiety she was filled with as she awaited her class of students to come filing into her classroom for the first time ever. It was a lovely September day, although, not as lovely as those days were in Brazil but lovely enough for Scotland. Her auburn hair was piled up into a bun ontop of her head, she wore a pair of bright yellow overalls and a blue shirt underneath the overalls. She was definitely not one to stray from bright colours and she loved to wear them.</p>

<p>The sound of stomping feet could be heard from outside of the classroom so the professor slipped outside of the room to stand in front of the door and greet students as they arrived. And boy did they arrive. Her room seemed to be filled with anywhere from 30 to 40 students, quite more than the young professor was expecting but it was a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>After watching the halls clear of people, Ainoa assumed that it was everyone and began to close the door only for what looked to be a frantic student come sprinting down the hall to Ainoa&#39;s classroom. The last student took her seat and the professor turned to address the class for the first and hopefully not last time.</p>

<p><b style="color: #7EAF68">&quot;Welcome to Ancient Runes, my dears! I&#39;m so excited to be your professor for the next five years and I look forward to teaching you everything that is to do with Runes! Today we&#39;re starting off with something fairly simple.&quot;</b> The professor moved throughout the room passing out name tags to each of the students, most of them groaning at another introduction they&#39;d have to make in class.</p>

<p><b style="color: #7EAF68">&quot;I promise you this is not what you think! I&#39;d like you guys to write out your name in what you think are runes and then please explain to your classmates why you wrote your name like that. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me as I&#39;ll be moving throughout the classroom today and introducing myself to you individually.&quot;</b></p>
