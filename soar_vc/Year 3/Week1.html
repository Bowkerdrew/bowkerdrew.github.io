<p>Rays of orange light fell upon the dimly lit classroom. Trinkets and artifacts from different cultures lined the shelves on the wall; each one with a wooden placard describing the item. 
Most of the students had already taken their seats, and were filling the room with quiet anticipation before the door to the professor’s office had opened. He shuffled to the large wooden desk and plopped a wooden crate full of more bric-a-brac on it with a soft puff of dust.</p>
 
<p><em class="dialogue">“Hello there,”</em> He began while idly patting the dust off of his old tweed jacket, <em class="dialogue">“My name is professor Armus Llewellyn. You, I hope, are here for the study of ancient runes.”</em>
Armus fiddled with his coat pockets until he found his wand, then gestured it to a large blackboard behind him. One of the chalk pieces animated itself and danced across the board, writing a series of runes. It then hopped below it and wrote out Armus’s name. </p>

<p><em class="dialogue">“Through the years in this class you will be introduced not only to the runes you see here, but writing systems around the world. Studying these will make it possible for you to translate texts, discover ancient secrets, and add to the history of wizardkind,”</em> Armus flicked his wand down, and the chalk dropped into its tray at the bottom of the blackboard. He picked up a few books from the crate in front of him. <em class="dialogue">“Many of the oldest stories you may have read as children are translated into modern language from their original runes. But not only fictional stories are recorded. Some of the most important stories are the stories of real people.”</em> </p>

<p><em class="dialogue">“Runes are our connection to the past, they are language and information. People just like you spent time writing about themselves, recording things they thought were important. Our writing system uses letters, which can be thought of as a type of rune."</em></p><p>Armus once again waved his wand. The dusty crate started to shoot out thin notebooks that flapped and flew like birds. One landed on each desk in front of the students. <em class="dialogue">"You will write down any assignments in one of these notebooks, and at the end of the year I will take them back to hold them for future generations."</p>  <p>"Today I am going to ask you all to write a little bit about yourself, where you’re from, and something you would like people from the future to know about you.” </em></p>
